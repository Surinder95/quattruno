CSUNHub

Website to help CSUN students share notes, books, and rides with other students.
Ridesharing is still a work in progress, however users can upload books to sell and notes to share with people who are in the same course.
Say for example, I'm taking CS101 and I upload a picture of my notes or a key topic from lecture, only students who are enrolled in CS101 classes
can view those notes. We do this by taking the user's class numbers (5 digit number) and matching them through CSUN's Metalab API to display the proper 
notes and books. 
You don't want to see Art History notes if you're not in any Art History class.
By the same token, we don't want freshman CS students to be able to view 3rd or 4th year CS course notes or textbooks.
